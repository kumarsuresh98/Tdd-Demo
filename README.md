# Tdd-Demo
This Sample code shows how to develop an application using TDD [Test Driven Development]. 
Start with Junit and makes fail the scenarios and move to actual production ready code.
Initially you may feel its hard to follow. But I am sure, if you practices this you can develop strong bug free/less code.
Also now a days, most of the companies are looking for developers who knows TDD.
Have to practice this in order to be upto the speed.
